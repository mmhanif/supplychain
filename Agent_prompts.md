- use uv to create a new project named simpy
- /init
    I'll analyze the SimPy codebase to create a comprehensive WARP.md file. Let me start by exploring the repository structure and understanding the project.
- using uv add the packages numpy, pandas and simpy to the project
- rename this project to simulation
- run the project
- run the project using uv
- [Claude] I want to use the python simpy module to implement the beer distribution "game". I want to create a UI that allows me to set various parameters for the simulation, to start, pause and stop the simulation and visualize the simulation state. Describe the high-level architecture you recommend for this.
- [Claude] Create an architecure.md file in the ~/code/simulation directory with the above architecture description
- Referencing the architecture in the beer_game_architecture.md file generate the python code for the simulation engine layer
- Again referencing beer_game_architecture.md as well as SIMULATION_ENGINE_DOCS.md implement the code for the game logic layer
- Again referencing beer_game_architecture.md as well as SIMULATION_ENGINE_DOCS.md and GAME_LOGIC_DOCS.md implement the code for the user interface layer
- uv run python run_web_server.py
- I get the error "connection rejected (403 Forbidden)" when trying to create a new game in the UI. Please diagnose
- Fix the following error:   File "/Users/mmhanif/code/simpy/simulation/web/api/websocket.py", line 415, in send_game_state
    state = game.get_current_state()
AttributeError: 'GameController' object has no attribute 'get_current_state'
- Fix the following error:   File "/Users/mmhanif/code/simpy/simulation/web/api/websocket.py", line 356, in handle_player_decision
    success = game.submit_player_decision(
  File "/Users/mmhanif/code/simpy/simulation/game/controller.py", line 336, in submit_player_decision
    self._advance_simulation()
  File "/Users/mmhanif/code/simpy/simulation/game/controller.py", line 597, in _advance_simulation
    self.simulation.env.run(until=self.state.current_week + 1)
  File "/Users/mmhanif/code/simpy/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/simpy/core.py", line 228, in run
    raise ValueError(
ValueError: until (52) must be greater than the current simulation time
- Fix the value error in the simulation.
- **SUCCESS!!** ...well it runs anyway
